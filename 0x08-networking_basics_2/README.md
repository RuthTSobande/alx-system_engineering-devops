This project is the second in a series on networking, I researched more into understanding IP addresses and their manipulation through Bash scripting.

Tasks:

1. Localhost
   - [0-localhost](./0-localhost): File explaining "localhost".
     - Options:
       1. A hostname referring to this IP.
       2. A hostname referring to this computer.
       3. An IP linked to a computer.

2. All IPs
   - [1-wildcard](./1-wildcard): File clarifying "0.0.0.0".
     - Options:
       1. All IPv4 addresses on the local machine.
       2. All IPs.
       3. It signifies null in networking.

3. Change Home IP
   - [2-change_your_home_IP](./2-change_your_home_IP): Bash script configuring an Ubuntu server to:
     - Resolve localhost to 127.0.0.2.
     - Resolve facebook.com to 8.8.8.8.

4. Show Attached IPs
   - [3-show_attached_IPs](./3-show_attached_IPs): Bash script displaying all active IPv4 IPs on the machine.

5. Port Listening on Localhost
   - [4-port_listening_on_localhost](./4-port_listening_on_localhost): Bash script listening on port 98 on localhost.
